# pel-pdf-spreadsheet
The macOS Number spreadsheet used to create the [PEL PDF files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/master/doc/pdf/-index.pdf).

Note that I am not updating this repo very often.
If you want me to update it to get the latest source I use
to create the PEL PDF files, please request it by creating an
issue inside this repository.
